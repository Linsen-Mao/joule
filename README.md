# Joule

## Overview

Joule is a digital assistant service that allows users to:

1. **Define a name and response string** for a digital assistant.
2. **Send text messages** to the named assistant and receive predefined responses.
3. **Ask questions** related to uploaded materials and receive intelligent answers.
4. **Upload PDF documents** for the assistant to process, using an event-driven approach.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, make sure you have the following installed and configured on your system:

- **Docker Desktop** with Docker and Docker Compose installed
- **Kubernetes** enabled in Docker Desktop
- An **OpenAI API Key**. Obtain one by signing up on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure the OpenAI API Key in Kubernetes

To secure your OpenAI API key, you should store it as a Kubernetes secret and reference it in the deployment file.

Run the following command to create the secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic openai-secret --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-actual-openai-api-key>
```

### 2. Deploy the Application

Use the `deploy.sh` script to build, push, and deploy the application to Kubernetes. This script will handle all necessary steps, including starting the database and configuring the application on Kubernetes.

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

If you want to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the `SPRING_AI_VECTORSTORE_PGVECTOR_ACTIVATED` variable should be set to `true`.
**Note:** Please upload documents first if you choose to use RAG.

```bash
kubectl set env deployment/app SPRING_AI_VECTORSTORE_PGVECTOR_ACTIVATED=true
```


### 3. Access the Application

Once deployed, the service will start on **`http://localhost:8080`**. You can verify everything is running by checking the status of the Kubernetes resources:

```bash
kubectl get pods,deployments,services
```
